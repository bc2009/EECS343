## Discription

As you can deduce from the allocation of weights for grading, programming projects make up a major portion of this class. There will be four (4) projects. All projects are to be done by teams of two to three (2-3) people. Team members should work cooperatively on the design, implementation, and testing of their solution.

The following table of deadlines should serve you as a guideline for planning your quarter. You are given about two weeks per project. This should be plenty of time if managed carefully. Keep in mind that projects cannot be handed in more than three days late (check the course late policy for details).

You can get a copy of the handout and skeleton for any of your projects here. The skeleton for any project would be available in the format blah.tar.gz. You should save (transfer) this file to your Unix box and run % gunzip blah.tar.gz and % tar xvf blah.tar, in that order. This will create a skeleton directory that will include the source code and makefile for the skeleton as well as the associated regression testing framework.

## Code Walkthrough

As part of every project grading a subset of 2-8 teams will be randomly selected to conduct a walkthrough of their code for the TAs and instructor. A walkthrough is a form of software peer review in which a designer or programmer leads participants through the software product, while the participants ask questions and make comments on code functionality, style, compliance to standards, etc.

Note: To be granted full credit for a project you must be able to carry the walkthrough and unquestionably show a full understanding of your own code.

A few points on the topic

* For each of the four projects during the quarter, between 2-8 teams will be selected to conduct a walkthrough
* The selection will be random with replacement; in other words, your team could be selected multiple times over the quarter
* The walkthrough must be done in the first week immediately following submission
* All team members must be present; one of the members will conduct the walkthrough while the other(s) take note of the questions and comments
* Every participant (TAs, instructor and members of other teams) can ask question about and comment on the code
* All members of the team conducting the code-review must drive the walkthrough at different times during the meeting
* Members of other teams present during a code review session are require to provide comments on the code being presented (besides their own). They can submit their comments to the TA after the session for a total of 2.5% extra (from total) points.
